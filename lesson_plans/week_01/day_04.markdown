# Check-In

# Code Review

# Code Review

1. **Readability**: Indentation, spacing, naming
2. **Sandi's Rules** (esp. 5 lines per method)
3. **Test Construction**:
  + Do the tests make sense?
  + Is the output useful?
4. **Troubleshooting**

---

# Code Review

Work in pairs or groups of 3. Take notes on feedback provided. Accept feedback without arguing or explaining (feel free to ask clarifying questions), then critically evaluate it later.

# Minitest

---

# Minitest

You'll watch the video (link in Slack and in the GitHub issues), either alone or in small groups, and you'll follow along as best you can. Pause the video frequently to copy whatever happens.

# Convert NameGenerator to use Minitest

---

# Convert NameGenerator

1. Rename your `name_generator_test.rb`:
  + `git mv name_generator_test.rb old_test.rb`
  + Run it, then see if it still works
2. Create a new, official test file:
  + `touch name_generator_test.rb`
3. Populate the test-file with a stub test and see if it works

# Convert NameGenerator

4. Create a `test_helper.rb`
5. Create a `Rakefile`
6. Start copying your tests over, one by one
  + Run `rake` between each to make sure it works

---

# Convert NameGenerator

7. Once all your tests pass like they did before, start revising per the feedback given.

# Debugging Techniques

2. Write test cases
3. Trace it out
4. Rubber-Duck Debugging
5. Take a breather

# Data Types

---

# Data Types

1. Integers and Floats
2. Strings
3. Arrays
4. Hashes

---

# Integers

+ Whole numbers
+ The "default" choice
+ Can guarantee precision
+ No maximum value or maximum precision

---

# Floating Point Numbers

+ Whole numbers & rational numbers
+ Precision problems
+ No maximum value
+ Only accurate out to 7 or 8 decimal places at best
+ Be very careful with these

---

# Strings

+ Text, numbers, and symbols
+ Represented internally as a special array of characters
+ Building new strings and modifying strings in place is sometimes slow
+ By far, the most common data type
+ Use for any representation of text you don't need to do math to

---

# Arrays

+ Lists of similar things
+ Can iterate very quickly
+ Inserting or adding new items can be slow, but not usually in a way we'd notice
+ Often ordered (or sortable) for fast searching (binary search, etc.)

---

# Hashes

+ Key / Value pairs
+ Useful when you have groups of related data (of the same or different types)
+ Key is usually a `:symbol`
+ Value can be anything (number, string, array, object, another hash, etc.)
+ Great for looking things up and for counting

# Assertions

1. `assert` or `refute`
2. `assert_equal` or `refute_equal`
3. `assert_includes` or `refute_includes`
4. `assert_nil` or `refute_nil`
5. `assert_empty` or `refute_empty`
6. `assert_raises` or no counterpart
7. `assert_respond_to` or `refute_respond_to`

# Catch Up & Leap Forward

# Catch Up

If you have any assignments from this past week that you haven't yet completed to your satisfaction, take some time this weekend to finish those up as best you can. Get one assignment done before moving on to the next.

---

# Homework (Everyone)

By noon on Sunday, pick one assignment you have done so far and send me the link to the GitHub repository. I'll review and leave notes.

---

# Homework (Everyone)

**Journal Prompt**: What did you learn last week? Make a list? What things came hard? What do you still struggle with? How are you feeling? How are you doing? 

---

# Homework (Everyone)

Try to take a full day off this weekend. Go do something not related to class.  I'll suggest doing something with your hands or with your body, but do whatever you need to recharge and be ready for next week.

---

# Bonus Homework

Pick one of these and give it a shot. Try writing tests. Some of these problems are fairly difficult. Links to the repositories in the issues.

1. "Look and Say"
2. "Collatz Conjecture"
3. "Arbitrarily Long Hallway with Evenly Spaced Lights"
4. "Elevator Instructions"

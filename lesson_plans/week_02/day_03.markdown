# Check-In and Homework

---

# Live Debugging

---

# More Interactions Between Objects

---

# Driver Methods

---

# Driver Methods

When your code is split into multiple classes, you can use Pry to interact with any one class.

---

# Driver Methods

But it's not reasonable to expect your users to do this.

---

# Driver Methods

Since each of our classes are responsible for managing themselves, what we will probably want is another class (or file, or method, or...) responsible for running the whole thing.  

---

# Driver Methods

This is called a *Driver Method* (or sometimes a *Driver Class*, if it needs to be a class).

---

# Helper Classes

---

# Helper Classes

Additionally, sometimes we have little tasks or responsibilities that don't *quite* fit under the purview of one of our classes, or that are shared between classes.

---

# Helper Classes

If this is the case, it may be worthwhile to extract that part of the code into a *helper class* (or *utility class*).

---

# Helper Classes

Helper classes don't usually represent real-world objects (domain objects).  They're just there to perform a single job (or closely related set of jobs).

---

# GitHub Issues

# Homework & Check-In

---

# Many-to-Many Relationships

---

# Mini-Project

# Mini-Project

Given the existing models (and tests), create a many-to-many relationship between them and test it in Pry.

# Web Applications with Sinatra

# Homework

---

# Homework - A

Sketch out and build the models, complete with relationships and validators, specified. Don't worry about building a driver. The tests should pass and it should work in Pry.

---

# Homework - B

Build out a sample (or several sample) Sinatra applications. Get really comfortable with defining routes, using the `params` hash, and working with your code.

---

# Homework - C

Become comfortable with HTML. You should be able to:

1. Make headers and paragraphs.
2. Create forms with text fields, drop-down selects, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons. These forms shouldn't do anything yet.
3. Create links to other pages.

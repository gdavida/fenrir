# Sidebar: How to Practice

1. Pick a page on a site.
2. Set a timer - 30 to 90 minutes is probably good.
3. See how close you can get to building that page or component without looking at the inspector.
4. After you're done, or after the timer goes off, check out what you were building with the inspector.

Additionally, take the time to examine pages with neat elements. All the HTML, CSS, and Javascript are exposed to you. Make use of this.

You don't need any particular talent to be a good enough designer that you can design something relatively usable.

---

# Sidebar: How to Practice

You don't need any design talent at all to become good at working with HTML and CSS as it pertains to building things other people designed.

# CSS: Inline and Block Elements

*Inline* elements, like `<b>`, flow and stay on the same line.

*Block* elements, like `<div>` and `<li>`, occupy their own line.

We can modulate these with `display: inline;` or `display; block` (or `display: inline-block;`!)

# Strategies

# Strategies

The single best strategy we can use is to consider design-components of a page, instead of thinking about HTML elements. The HTML elements are a means to an end.

---

# Strategies

Just like with Bootstrap, think about breaking elements down into rows and columns, if possible.

---

# Strategies

Even if you can't do this, think about breaking the page into components, each of which might be made of sub-components.

---

# Strategies

The trick is to write your CSS and HTML in such a way that you have the freedom to quickly change your layout or styling. Adding, changing, or removing elements from a page shouldn't break the entire page.

Avoid fragile layouts.

# Strategies

We'll talk later this week about how to keep our HTML and CSS from being fragile.

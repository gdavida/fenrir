# Agenda for the Week

1. Learn enough Bootstrap to be able to handle common layout tasks
2. Learn enough CSS to be dangerous
  + Determine position of elements on the screen
  + Determine styling of elements
3. Re-style our projects from last week with more fluid and reasonable layouts
   and styles
4. Build the following components from scratch (using HTML and CSS):
  + Navbar
  + Text on an image
  + Three-column page
  + Rows and Columns (making sure to use the clearfix)
  + Elements in front of and behind other elements
5. **Advanced**:
  + Flexbox (instead of grid)
  + Relative units (`%`, `em`, and `rem`) instead of absolute units (`px`)
  + BEM-style modifiers
  + Object Oriented CSS

# Project Show & Tell

1. Pick a single feature
2. Walk us through that feature, making sure to show all relevant code. Consider this as a curated tour.

---

# Check-In & Feelings

1. How are you doing this week relative to last week?
2. How did Howlr go relative to your project from the previous week? What parts of the process went well? Which parts didn't? Why?
3. What will you do differently in future (full-stack) projects based on what you've learned so far?

---

# Homework Review

---

# Javascript!

1. The role of Javascript
2. Javascript on a page
3. The basic structures (brief review)
4. `prompt` and `alert`
5. Our first event listener

---

# Homework!

---

# Homework A

Given the starter HTML, write some Javascript to complete these exercises (matching the video). The exercises might look a bit familiar. Each piece should go in its own function which you call with an `onClick` attribute.

If you need to, go back and review Exercises **1 - 44** in *ASWtLJ* (or equivalent material).

---

# Homework B

Do Exercises **45 - 68** in *ASWtLJ*. By tomorrow morning, you should be able
to:

+ Describe the DOM
+ Select DOM elements within a page by ID or Class
+ Adjust styles, contents, or other attributes of DOM elements

---

# Homework C

**Journal Prompt**: Do some comparing and contrasting (with code samples) between Javascript and Ruby. How are variables created? What data types exist?  How about `if`-statements? Loops? Arrays? Methods? What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of Javascript as compared to Ruby? Given the four languages we know so far (Ruby, Javascript, HTML, and CSS), what is the purpose of each? How do they combine to form an application? How do they fit into the MVC structure as you know it so far?

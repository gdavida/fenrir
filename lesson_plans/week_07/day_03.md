# Homework & Check-In

---

# `debugger`

Remember `binding.pry`? We can do the same thing in Javascript. Just toss `debugger` in the middle of a function; when the console hits the `debugger` line, it'll stop.

This makes working with Javascript infinitely more pleasant.

# Event Listeners

---

# Event Listeners

1. What are events?
2. What kinds of events exist?
2. How do we listen for them?
3. How do we add an event listener to an element?
4. How do we remove an event listener from an element?
5. `window.addEventListener("load", setUpPage);`

# Homework

Build a [Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://github.com/star-city-code-school/w07-d03-tic-tac-toe).

I've provided some HTML for you. You can build the CSS and Javascript. You may choose to modify the HTML to make it easier to work with, but this assignment is complete-able without making any changes (except getting rid of dummy information).

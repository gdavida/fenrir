Lesson plans are available in `/lesson-plans` (under the appropriate week).

This repository is the central hub for Star City Code School - Fenrir students (March 2016 -
June 2016). This is where we'll gather, post assignments, and do a few other things.

Don't worry if you're not yet familiar with GitHub; we'll get there.
